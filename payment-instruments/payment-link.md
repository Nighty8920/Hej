  The implementation sequence for this scenario is a variant of the purchase
  sequence in a Hosted Payment Pages redirect scenario.
  The payer is not redirected to the payment pages directly but will instead
  receive a payment link via mail/SMS.
  When the payer clicks on the link a payment window opens.
