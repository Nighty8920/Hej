## After payment options for Mobile Pay

### Options after posting a payment

* **Abort:** It is possible to [abort a payment][technical-reference-abort] if the payment has no successful transactions.
* If the payment shown above is done as a two-phase (`authorization`), you will need to implement the `Capture` and `Cancel` requests.
* For reversals, you will need to implement the `Reversal` request.
* **If CallbackURL is set:** Whenever changes to the payment occur Â a [Callback request][technical-reference-callback] will be posted to the `callbackUrl`, generated when the payment was created.


## Capture

The `captures` resource lists the capture transactions performed on a specific payment.
