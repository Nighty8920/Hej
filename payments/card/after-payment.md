## Options after posting a payment

When you detect that the payer reach your `completeUrl` , you need to do a `GET`
request on the payment resource, containing the `paymentID` generated in the
first step, to receive the state of the transaction. You will also be able to
see the available operations after posting a payment.

{% include payment-resource.md %}

* *Abort:* It is possible to abort the process if the payment has no successful
  transactions. [See the Abort description here][abort].
* If the payment shown above is done as a two phase (`Authorization`), you will
  need to implement the `Capture` and `Cancel` requests.
* For `reversals`, you will need to implement the [Reversal request][reversal].
* If `CallbackURL` is set: Whenever changes to the payment occur a [Callback
  request][callback] will be posted to the `callbackUrl`, which was generated
  when the payment was created.

## Capture

The capture transaction is the when you ensure that the funds are charged from
the consumer. This step usaully takes place when the product has exchanged
possession. One must first do a `GET` request on the payment to find the
`create-capture` operation.

### Create capture transaction

To create a `capture` transaction to withdraw money from the payer's card, you
need to perform the `create-capture` operation.

### Capture Sequence

`Capture` can only be done on a authorized transaction. It is possible to do a
part-capture where you only capture a part of the authorization amount. You can
later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  activate Merchant
  Merchant->>-SwedbankPay: POST [Credit card captures]
  activate SwedbankPay
  SwedbankPay-->>-Merchant: transaction resource
```

## Cancellations

`Cancel` can only be done on a authorized transaction. If you do cancel after
doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference between the capture amount
and the authorization amount.

### Create cancellation transaction

Perform the `create-cancel` operation to cancel a previously created - and not
yet captured - payment.

`Delete payment token` request.

  beforehand, you need to contact
